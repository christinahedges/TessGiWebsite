  Warning for Sector 18: Due an eclipse of the spacecraft by the Earth no data was taken for 6.2hrs in orbit 43.
The FFI timestamps for Sector 18 are incorrect. The readouts of the four cameras are staggered by 0.5 sec.

During this time, the instrument was turned off and no data were collected for 6.2 hours between TJD 1791.1115 and 1791.3699. The thermal state of the spacecraft changed during this time, and trends in the raw photometry and target positions are apparent after data collection resumed. However, the pipeline effectively removes these trends in the PDC light curves.</td>

       <td colspan="5">The FFI timestamps for Sector 18 are incorrect.  The readouts of the four cameras are staggered by 0.5 seconds in the following order: Camera 1 (0 second offset), Camera 3 (0.5 second offset), Camera 4 (1.0 second offset), and Camera 2 (1.5 second offset). Although these offsets are correctly incorporated into the timestamps in the target pixel files and light curves, the FFI time stamps are not corrected for the staggered readout. For Sector 1 through Sector 18, the offsets for each camera can be added to the TSTART and TSTOP header values in the FFIs to correct the issue.<p></p>
       In addition, the TSTOP header values in the target pixel files, light curve files, and FFIs are overestimated by 20 ms, and the TIME column of the target pixel files and light curve files are overestimated by 10 ms.<p></p>
