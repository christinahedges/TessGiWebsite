	   - Cadences with insufficient targets to derive cotrending basis vectors are flagged and the PDCSAP FLUX light curves are set to NULL at these times<p></p>
	   The modifications to the data anomaly flags also changed the cotrended light curves produced by PDC. The changes also result in new cotrending basis vectors for each CCD in each sector. The scattered light flags are now only applied to the PDCSAP FLUX light curves.</td>
