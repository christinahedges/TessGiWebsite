	 <td colspan="2">Anomalous detector voltage change:</td>
	 <td colspan="5">Beginning 2023-05-19 13:54 UTC (3084.1 TJD) and lasting 3.4 days, Camera 4, CCD 4
	   experienced an anomalous detector voltage change leading to a 70% gain and 0.5◦
	   temperature change. After a commanded instrument reset, data collection resumed at the nominal
	   operating conditions with no lasting impact due to the anomaly. The anomaly did not affect
	   spacecraft fine pointing. No other cameras or CCDs were affected.
	   <p>Camera 4, CCD 4 FFI data during this time is not available on the MAST archive. FFI
	     data for all other Cameras and CCDs were not impacted by the anomaly and are available on
	     the MAST archive. For 2-min and 20-sec data products (TPF & LC), the Bad Calibration
	     Exclude data quality flag (bit 15) is set for targets on Camera 4, CCD 4 during the 3.4-day
	     anomaly, and these cadences were not used for PDC CBVs or the planet search in TPS
	     and DV. Non-NULL pixel data present in TPFs for Camera 4, CCD 4 during the 3.4-day
	     anomaly should be regarded as not calibrated and not suitable for scientific analysis using
	     standard techniques.</p>

download periods from Orbit 137a to 137b and Orbit 138a to 138b. However, there is no
data during this time and values in the target pixel files and light curves are set to NULL.
Off-nominal data downlink contacts resulted in the instrument solid state recorder filling
to capacity. In this case, old data is maintained and new data is not recorded. Overall, 17
hours of observations at the end Orbit 138 were not recorded.</td>
