The Cycle 4 NASA Research Announcment has been release with details of the [upcoming proposal call](proposing-investigations.html). Proposals will be due at 4.30pm on January 22, 2021. Cycle 4 observations begin in June 2021 and end in September 2022, covering observing sectors 40-56. Observations in Cycle 4 will cover the Northern Ecliptic Hemisphere and the Ecliptic Plane.

The Cycle 4 solicitation can be found on [NSPIRES](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7}&path=open). Cycle 4 is longer than a typical cycle and lasting approximately 15 months.

Cycle 4 will have a dual-anonymous peer review. Under this system the reviewers do not have knowledge of the proposal teams while they perform their scientific evaluation of the proposal. Proposers should consult the [Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals document](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=736703/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/Guidelines%20for%20Anonymous%20Proposals%20DAPR%20Doc%20Astro%20GO%20Programs.pdf) on the NSPIRES of this program element for instructions on writing proposals appropriate for dual-anonymous peer review.

There are three categories of TESS GI proposals for Cycle 4; investigators are free to select the category that best reflects their scope of their proposed work. 

* Mini proposals - This is a new proposal category. These programs require minimal resources, up to 50 20-second cadence targets and 1,000 2-minute cadence targets. Proposals in this category are not eligible for funding.
* Small proposals - Proposals of limited scope.
* Large proposals - Proposals of wide-ranging scope and science yield. Large proposals must deliver a clear benefit for the broader scientific community.

As with Cycle 3, can request 20-second cadence targets, 2-min targets, and funding to support analysis of TESS data, include full-frame images. Additionally, proposals that support the acquisition and analysis of scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Ground-based observing focused proposals may support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS scientific data collected in Cycle 4 or TESS data already collected in Cycles 1-3.

The TESS GI program can also award Swift observations through a joint program with the Swift mission. Up to 100 ks Swift time will be available through this program. Small programs are eligible for up to $70,000 and large programs for up to $250,000.
