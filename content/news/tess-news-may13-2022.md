Welcome TESS followers! This week we are looking at three papers from the archive. Enjoy!

**[The Discovery of a Planetary Companion Interior to Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02501)** *(Hord et al., 2022)* **:**

Hot Jupiters are predominantly lonely. At the time of writing, only three out of the ~500 confirmed transiting Hot Jupiters have known companions (WASP-47, Kepler-730 and TOI-1130). This paper presents the discovery and validation of WASP-132 c, a planetary companion interior to the orbit of the Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b. WASP-132 c has a radius of 12.0 R⊕, and an orbital period of 1.01 days. Hord et al. combined TESS photometry, ground-based archival and follow-up observations, and vetting and validation tools to rule out common false positives and confirm the planetary nature of the companion. Spectroscopic measurements from the CORALIE spectrograph place a 3 sigma upper limit of 37.35 M⊕ for the mass of WASP-132 c. Such systems provide deeper understanding of the connection between planet formation and the observed population. The authors of the paper suggest that the presence of WASP-132 c argues against a high-eccentricity migration scenario for the formation of the Hot Jupiter WASP-132 b. See Fig. 1 below and the paper for more details. 
 

**[Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03934)** *(Zasche, Henzl & Masek, 2022)* **:**

Eclipsing binary stars represent ideal astrophysical laboratories to study basic stellar properties such as mass, radius, luminosity, etc. In turn, large-scale photometric surveys such as TESS provide unique opportunity to study eclipsing binaries in triple and higher-order stellar systems. A particularly interesting subset of such systems are quadruple stars with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration where each binary pair is eclipsing. Zasche et al. used TESS data to discover 25 triply-eclipsing triple stars and 116 doubly-eclipsing quadruple stars. Some of the targets exhibit eclipse-time variations indicating possible period changes and relatively short mutual orbital periods. The authors also suggest that V0871 Can is a potential septuple star with a (Aa+Ab)+B+C+D configuration. These systems bring important new insight into the formation mechanism of stars in multiple systems. They also enable ``real time'' studies of orbital evolution, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, precession and inclination changes, etc. See Fig. 2 below and the paper for more details.


**[Kepler K2 and TESS observations of two magnetic cataclysmic variables: The new asynchronous polar SDSS J084617.11+245344.1 and Paloma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02863)** *(Littlefield et. al.,  2022)* **:**

In this paper the authors present their analysis of two magnetic cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), SDSS J084617.11+245344.1 and Paloma. These are very-short period binary systems composed of a white dwarf and a main sequence star (usually M-dwarf) that interact with each other via accretion flows from the latter to the former. At the time of writing, there are only a handful of confirmed asynchronous polar magnetic CVs with continuous, long-duration photometric observations. TESS observed Paloma, a rare intermediate-asynchronous hybrid polar, in short-cadence during Sector 19, and helped confirm that the spin period is 2.27 hours, resolving a previous ambiguity between 2.27 hours and 2.43 hours. The TESS lightcurve is shown in Fig. 3 below. Based on the TESS data, Littlefield et al. argue that Paloma experiences either pole switching or a grazing eclipse of one of the emitting regions, and suggest that future observations are needed to discern between the two scenarios.
