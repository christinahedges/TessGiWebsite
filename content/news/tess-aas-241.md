Join us for a TESS workshop on Saturday, January 7, 2023 from 9am-5pm PST at [AAS 241 in Seattle, WA](https://aas.org/meetings/aas241). Registration is available via the [AAS portal](https://aas.org/meetings/aas241/registration).

This full day workshop is presented to the community to learn about TESS, review how to obtain data and research funding through the TESS General Investigator Program, and understand how to quickly use your selected data, all of which is available with no exclusive access period. 

This workshop is ideal for both new and established users of TESS data. New users will learn how and where to get started. More experienced users can check out the new 200s observing mode and updated analysis techniques. We welcome scientists at all career stages, working on all topics including extragalactic, stellar, and exoplanet astronomy. We additionally encourage attendance from anyone interested in proposing for TESS observations.

The workshop will consist of short talks introducing the NASA TESS mission, explanations of how to propose for TESS observations and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls, tutorials on working with TESS data, and an interactive learn-with-the-experts session to show you how to utilize TESS data on your own targets. Please bring a laptop for this interactive session!

Additionally, If you are attending AAS 241, and plan to present TESS results you think would be of broad interest to the public, [please submit a media request](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/media.html). We would love to showcase as many TESS results as possible, but need time to prepare stories and graphics. Therefore, if you are interested in having your work promoted, submit a media request as soon as possible!
