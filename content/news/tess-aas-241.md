Join us for a TESS workshop that will take place Saturday, January 7, 2023 from 9am-5pm PST at [AAS 241 in Seattle, WA](https://aas.org/meetings/aas241). Registration is available via the [AAS portal](https://aas.org/meetings/aas241/registration).

This full day workshop is presented to the community to learn about TESS, learn how to obtain data (and research funding!) through the TESS General Investigator Program, and learn how to quickly get to work with the data, all of which is available with no exclusive access period. This workshop is ideal for both new and established users of TESS data. New users can expect to learn where to get started with obtaining and using data. More experienced users can expect to learn about the new 200s observing mode and updated analysis techniques. We welcome scientists at all career stages, working on all topics including extragalactic astronomy, stellar astronomy, and exoplanet astronomy. We additionally encourage attendance from anyone interested in proposing for TESS observations.

The workshop will consist of; i) short minute talks introducing the NASA TESS mission ii) explanations of how to propose for TESS observations and obtain research funding in upcoming proposal calls iii) tutorials on working with TESS data and iv) an interactive work-with-the-experts session to show you how to work with TESS data on your own targets. Please bring a laptop for this interactive session!

Additionally, If you are also attending AAS 241, and you plan to present TESS results that you think would be of broad interest to the public, [please submit a media request](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/media.html). We would love to showcase as many TESS results as possible, but we need time to prepare stories and graphics. Therefore, we ask that if you are interested in having your work promoted, you submit a media request as soon as possible.
