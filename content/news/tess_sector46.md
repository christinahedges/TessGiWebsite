Hello TESS followers and welcome to this special news bulletin.

We want to inform you that the TESS mission will be changing the pointing for Sector 46 (Orbits 99 and 100).
Sector 46 is scheduled to begin December 2, 2021.

Due to pointing constraints, the pointing for Sector 46 will be shifted by 11.4 degrees westward (along the ecliptic plane).
Please be sure to make note of this change in pointing, particularly if coordinated observations are being planned for targets in this sector. 
 
The pointing change has been incorporated into the [Web TESS Viewing Tool (WTV)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py) and also [tess-point](https://github.com/christopherburke/tess-point). The changes are also reflected at the [MIT TESS website](https://tess.mit.edu/observations/).
