Hello and welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin! Here we will discuss the results of the Cycle 5 proposal season.

The Cycle 5 review was held earlier this year in May, with over 100 proposals submitted. Of these proposals 3 were Key, 7 were large, 77 small, and 14 mini. These proposals were split into one of four fields: Exoplanet (24), Stellar Astrophysics (42), Accretion and Extragalactic (15), and Ground-based Focused (20). The proposals were then assessed by one of five panels.

In total 49 proposals were accepted with the following breakdown:
