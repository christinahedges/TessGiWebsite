The TESS team is looking forward to attending the upcoming [AGU fall meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting) meeting in Chicago from December 12th through December 15th.  

Members from both the TESS GI and MIT offices will be there staffing a booth all week, allowing us to serve as a live Helpdesk for all your TESS-related questions. 

During the event Dr. Rebekah Hounsell will be presenting a Hyperwall talk all about TESS and its extended mission. The talk will occur at the NASA Hyperwall stage on Tuesday December 13th, at 4:35 pm - 4:50 pm (CST).
