The TESS team is hosting a TESS Splinter Session at AAS 241 on Tuesday, January 10th, 2023 from 6pm-8:30pm PST at the Seattle Conference Center, Room 4c-3.
 
NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been in operation since July 2018, monitoring millions of stars across the entire sky and discovering thousands of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates. TESS's capability for precision photometry over long time baselines, as well as open access to TESS data, have resulted in extraordinarily high scientific output from the mission across a broad range of astrophysics.
 
In September 2022, TESS began operations as part of its 2nd Extended Mission. A major highlight of the 2nd Extended Mission is a faster full frame image cadence of 200 seconds.
 
In this Splinter session, we provide an overview of the TESS Extended Mission operations and science goals. We particularly showcase TESS's impact across all areas of astronomy, sharing some of the exciting new science being conducted with TESS including exoplanet detections, Solar System science, stellar physics and population studies, and discoveries of transient events and other time-domain astronomy. 
 
This session will be a hybrid event allowing for virtual and in person attendance. Please note however that you must be registered for AAS 241 to participate in person.
 
Full details about the session schedule and the WebEx/Zoom link for virtual participation, will be provided at a later date and advertised on the TESS General Investigator home page.
