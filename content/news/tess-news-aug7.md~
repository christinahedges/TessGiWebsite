`STATUS UPDATE: Data from the last Sector of the TESS Prime mission is currently being ingested at the archive.`

Hello TESS followers, and welcome to our weekly news bulletin! This week we have a slightly shorter news bulletin, featuring one archive paper. 

**[Low Albedo Surfaces of Lava Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02789)** *(Essack et. al., 2020 :*
A hot super Earth is an explanet with a short orbital period of less than 10 days. These planets are heated to a high temperature by the host star causing the rocky surface to become molten. Some hot super Earths exhibit high geometric albedos. The authors of this paper aim to determine if the reflection from molten lava and quenched glasses on the surfaces of a hot super Earth contributes to the observationally inferred high geometric albedos.

To do this they  measure reflection from rough and smooth textured quenched glasses of both basalt and feldspar melts. For lava reflectance values, they used the specular reflectance values of molten silicates from non-crystalline solids in the literature.

The investigation indicates that lava planets with solid or liquid surfaces have low albedos. High albedos observed are likely due to atmospheres with reflective clouds. The authors went on to identify potential lava-ocean planet candidates within the TESS object of interest (TOI) list.

Lava-ocean planet candidates from the TESS TOI list are denoted by open symbols. Planets are colored by GAIA magnitude of host star. Panel A: Equilibrium temperatures calculated assuming a basalt quenched glass albedo (Ag = 0.09). Panel B: Equilibrium temperatures calculated assuming a feldspar quenched glass albedo (Ag = 0.02). See  Essack et. al., (2020) for more details.*
