Welcome TESS community to this special news bulletin!

We would like to inform you of an update to the Web TESS Viewing Tool (WTV). This tool has now been replaced by the new and improved [TESS-point Web Tool](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/wsgi-scripts/TESS/TESS-point_Web_Tool/TESS-point_Web_Tool/wtv_v2.0.py), which has all the same functions, but is more precise and streamlined. We hope that you enjoy this tool and find it useful for your Cycle 6 proposals
