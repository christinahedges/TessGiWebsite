Hello and welcome TESS followers to this special news bulletin! Here we will discuss the results of the Cycle 4 proposal season.

The Cycle 4 review was held earlier this year in March, with 146 proposals submitted. Of these proposals 12 were large, 110 small, and 24 mini - our most recent proposal category. 
These 146 proposals were split into one of four fields: Exoplanet (33), Stellar Astrophysics (62), Accretion and Extragalactic (19), and Ground-based Focused (32). The proposals were then assessed by one of seven panels. 

In total 62 proposals were accepted with the following breakdown:

Congratulations to all successful PI's and Co-I's!
To those of you who did not receive acceptance letters this time round, we strongly encourage you to apply again in the future. 
Thank you all for the wonderful science proposed, it is through your hard work that the TESS mission is a success.
