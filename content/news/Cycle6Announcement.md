The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) General Investigator (GI) Program (ROSES D.10) solicits proposals for the acquisition and analysis of new scientific data from the TESS Explorer mission. Additionally, proposals that support the acquisition and/or analysis of scientific data from ground-based telescopes are solicited. Such ground-based programs must directly support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS scientific data. Observations associated with TESS GI Cycle 6 will be executed from September 2023 until October 2024, covering observing [sectors 70 - 83](https://tess.mit.edu/tess-year-6-observations/). Proposals are solicited for targets in Northern Ecliptic Hemisphere fields and in fields along on the ecliptic plane. The observing plan for Cycle 6 will be posted at [https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov](https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov) once finalized.
