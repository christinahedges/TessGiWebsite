Title: Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program
Save_as: ddt.html

[TOC]

The [DDT and out-of-cycle Target of Opportunity](https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/) processes for TESS draws on those used successfully for the NuStar Explorer mission. Requests and targets will be submitted through a form on the [MIT TESS website](https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/). The requests will be reviewed by the TESS PI, a science expert selected by the TESS PI, and the TESS operations team. Approved targets will be posted on the MIT TESS website, along with the expected time(s) of observation.  There is no proprietary period for approved DDT observations. Data from a DDT observation will be delivered to the TESS archives concurrently with the non-DDT data from the sector in which the DDT is observed.

A number of targets per sector have been reserved for targets which are not covered in the GI target lists, yet may warrant inclusion as targets. Proposals for DDT targets can be submitted through MIT's [DDT program page](https://tess.mit.edu/science/ddt/).
