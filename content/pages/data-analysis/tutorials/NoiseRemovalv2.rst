Learning Goals
--------------

In this tutorial, we will teach the user how to remove scattered light
and noise from a *TESS* light curve.

The tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of python and astronomy,
and will walk the user through several of the concepts outlined below,

1. How to use *Lightkurve* to access the various data products and
   create time series.
2. How to account for instrumental and noise effects within your data
   using the Corrector class.

This tutorial is designed for users that have previous experience with
*Lightkurve*.

Imports
-------

This tutorial requires the use of specific packages: -
`Lightkurve <https://docs.lightkurve.org/index.html>`__ to work with
*TESS* data (v2.0.1) - `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ for
plotting. - `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`__ for manipulating the data.

First time users
----------------

If you are not that experienced with *Python*, or cannot download
*Lightkurve*, you can run this notebook as a `Colab
notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index>`__.
Colaboratory allows users to write and execute *Python* in your browser
with zero configuration required.

All you need is a Google account and to copy and paste in the following
command at the top of your colab notebook:

``!pip install lightkurve``

This downloads the *Lightkurve* package.

.. code:: ipython3

    import lightkurve as lk
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline 

Introduction to the Corrector Class
-----------------------------------

*TESS* light curves can often have systematic trends caused by noise
sources such as scattered light and instrumental effects. Only the
`LightCurve
objects <https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/1-getting-started/what-are-lightcurve-objects.html>`__
which have been fully processed, have had these effects removed. Data
derived from either
`TargetPixelFiles <https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/1-getting-started/what-are-targetpixelfile-objects.html>`__
or Full Frame Images must undergo further processing by the user to
remove these sources of noise.

To aid the user in this process, there exist several different tools
within the *Lightkurve* package. These are known as the `Corrector
class <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.corrector.Corrector.html?highlight=corrector%20class#lightkurve-correctors-corrector-corrector>`__.
We briefly describe each of these corrector classes below,

-  `CBVCorrector <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.CBVCorrector.html?highlight=cbvcorrector>`__:
   Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBVs) are generated from the most common
   systematic trends observed in each Sector. Each *TESS* CCD and Camera
   has its own set of CBVs. There are three basic types of CBVs,

   -  **Single-Scale**: Contains all systematic trends combined in a
      single set of basis vectors. Generally speaking, a single-scale
      CBV performs better at preserving longer period signals.
   -  **Multi-Scale**: Contains systematic trends in specific
      wavelet-based band passes. There are usually three sets of
      multi-scale basis vectors in three bands. This type of correction
      performs better when the periods are close to the transiting
      planet durations, and help to preserve the signal.
   -  **Spike**: Contains only short impulsive spike systematics. This
      correction is applied to remove short impulsive systematic
      signals.

-  `RegressionCorrector <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.RegressionCorrector.html?highlight=regressioncorrector>`__:
   Here the light curve is de-trended against vectors that we think are
   predictive of the systematic noise. For FFI data, we have to
   select/define an aperture for our object of interest. Pixels outside
   of this aperture are used to create vectors that are predictive of
   the noise. These vectors are then removed from the data.

-  `PLDCorrector <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.html?highlight=pldcorrector>`__:
   Pixel Level De-correlation (PLD) works by identifying a set of trends
   in the pixels surrounding the target star, and performing linear
   regression to create a combination of these trends that effectively
   models the systematic noise introduced by spacecraft motion/scattered
   light. This noise model is then subtracted from the uncorrected light
   curve. It is similar to the RegressionCorrector.

In this tutorial, we will apply each of these methods to our data and
compare the results. First, we need to obtain the data to test our
various Corrector functions.

1. How to use *Lightkurve* to access the various data products and create a time series
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Lightkurve <https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/index.html>`__ offers
a user-friendly way to analyze time series data obtained by telescopes,
in particular *TESS*. You can search for the various data products for
*TESS* on MAST using the following *Lightkurve* functions.

-  To look for your object in a full frame image:
   ```search_tesscut()`` <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.search_tesscut.html?highlight=search_tesscut>`__

-  To look for target pixel files:
   ```search_targetpixelfile()`` <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.search_targetpixelfile.html?highlight=search_targetpixelfile>`__

-  To obtain light curve files for your object of interest:
   ```search_lightcurve()`` <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.search_lightcurve.html?highlight=search_lightcurve>`__

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be examining `KT
Eri <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_Eridani>`__, a bright nova in the
constellation Eridanus that underwent an eruption in 2009.

To test our various methods of noise removal, we will be looking at FFI
data for this object. We can search `MAST <https://mast.stsci.edu>`__
for TESS FFI data on this object using the
`search_tesscut() <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.search_tesscut.html?highlight=search_tesscut#lightkurve.search_tesscut>`__
function.

.. code:: ipython3

    search_lc = lk.search_tesscut("KT Eri")
    search_lc




.. raw:: html

    SearchResult containing 2 data products.
    
    <table id="table140247469548816">
    <thead><tr><th>#</th><th>mission</th><th>year</th><th>author</th><th>exptime</th><th>target_name</th><th>distance</th></tr></thead>
    <thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>s</th><th></th><th>arcsec</th></tr></thead>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>TESS Sector 05</td><td>2018</td><td><a href='https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/'>TESScut</a></td><td>1426</td><td>KT Eri</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>TESS Sector 32</td><td>2020</td><td><a href='https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/'>TESScut</a></td><td>475</td><td>KT Eri</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
    </table>



We see that there are two sets of data, one from Sector 5 and the other
from Sector 32. Let’s look at the data from Sector 32. To download the
data we must specify a cut out size in pixels and use the
`download() <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/search.html?highlight=download>`__
function.

.. code:: ipython3

    S32 = search_lc[1].download(cutout_size=50)
    S32.plot()




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8da8e321d0>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_10_1.png


Note that this cut out is much larger than a typical FFI, this is
because when calculating our noise and systematics, we want a larger
sample of pixels from which the correction will be applied.

**Creating our light curve**

Great! Now we have our data, we can create our light curve using the
`to_lightcurve() <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.to_lightcurve.html?highlight=to_lightcurve#lightkurve.KeplerTargetPixelFile.to_lightcurve>`__
function. Our object is in the center, but it is kind of faint in
comparison to some other objects. We must therefore create our own
aperture as shown below.

.. code:: ipython3

    aper_new = np.zeros(S32.shape[1:], dtype=bool)
    aper_new[24:27, 24:27] = True
    S32.plot(aperture_mask=aper_new, mask_color='red')




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8dd96dcfd0>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_13_1.png


Excellent it covers our object! Let’s now make our light curve using
this aperture and plot the result.

.. code:: ipython3

    lc_S32 = S32.to_lightcurve(aperture_mask='threshold')
    lc_S32.plot(label="S32 FFI lc")




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8dd96dccd0>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_15_1.png


2. How to account for instrumental and noise effects within your data using the Corrector class
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can see from the above plot that our light curve is severely affected
by scattered light, which needs to be removed. To remove this noise,
let’s try our first method,

The CBVCorrector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we will use CBVs to remove our noise.

Check out our `CBV
tutorial <https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/2-creating-light-curves/2-3-how-to-use-cbvcorrector.html>`__
for more information.

First, we must import the *CBVCorrector* from *lightkurve.correctors*,
and then we can refer to our generate light curve.

.. code:: ipython3

    from lightkurve.correctors import CBVCorrector
    cbvCorrector = CBVCorrector(lc_S32, interpolate_cbvs=True)
    cbvCorrector.cbvs




.. parsed-literal::

    [TESS CBVs, Sector.Camera.CCD : 32.2.4, CBVType : SingleScale, nCBVS : 16,
     TESS CBVs, Sector.Camera.CCD : 32.2.4, CBVType.Band: MultiScale.1, nCBVs : 8,
     TESS CBVs, Sector.Camera.CCD : 32.2.4, CBVType.Band: MultiScale.2, nCBVs : 8,
     TESS CBVs, Sector.Camera.CCD : 32.2.4, CBVType.Band: MultiScale.3, nCBVs : 5,
     TESS CBVs, Sector.Camera.CCD : 32.2.4, CBVType : Spike, nCBVS : 7]



There are 5 sets of CBVs, all associated with Sector 32, Camera 2, CCD
4. The number of CBVs per type is also given. Let’s plot the
Single-Scale CBVs, which contain all systematics combined.

.. code:: ipython3

    cbvCorrector.cbvs[0].plot()




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8dd99f8810>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_19_1.png


The first several CBVs contain most of the systematics. The latter CBVs
pose a greater risk of injecting more noise than helping. The default
behavior in CBVCorrector is to use the first 8 CBVs.

Next, we need to decide what kind of CBV we want to apply. Since we want
to try not to overfit, we are going to use the Multi-Scale and Spike
options (see above for more details). We can specify the type via an
array as indicated below.

.. code:: ipython3

    cbv_type = ['MultiScale.1', 'MultiScale.2', 'MultiScale.3','Spike']

Since we only want to use the information from the first 8 CBV’s when we
use the SingleScale function, and all the Spike CBCs, we must also
specify this via an array.

.. code:: ipython3

    cbv_indices = [np.arange(1,9), np.arange(1,9), np.arange(1,9), 'ALL']

Now we want to check that the application of these vectors will not
under or over-fit our data. There is a handy way of checking this via
the use of a goodness_metric_scan_plot. A “Goodness Metric” value of 0.8
and above tends to indicate a good fit to the data.

.. code:: ipython3

    cbvCorrector.goodness_metric_scan_plot(cbv_type=cbv_type, cbv_indices=cbv_indices);
    plt.plot([1.5e-1, 1.5e-1], [0,1])




.. parsed-literal::

    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f8d8a297290>]




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_25_1.png


The above plot indicates that a regularization factor alpha value of
1.5e-1 is appropriate for our data. We can now specify this and check it
via a diagnose method.

.. code:: ipython3

    cbvcorrector = CBVCorrector(lc_S32, interpolate_cbvs=True)
    cbvcorrector.correct_gaussian_prior(cbv_type=cbv_type, cbv_indices=cbv_indices, alpha=1.5e-1)
    pltAxis = cbvcorrector.diagnose()
    pltAxis[0].set_ylim(300, 500);
    pltAxis[1].set_ylim(300, 500);



.. image:: output_27_0.png


.. code:: ipython3

    cbvcorrector_lc = cbvcorrector.corrected_lc
    cbvcorrector_lc.remove_outliers().plot()




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8debd37ad0>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_28_1.png


We can see that a correction was applied which has removed some of the
slope from our data and also labeled the big spike as an outlier.

The above method can be adjusted more, but for now, let’s move onto our
next method.

The RegressionCorrector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that this method relies on looking at pixels outside of our
previously defined object aperture to determine our systematics. We can
apply regression correction as follows.

.. code:: ipython3

    #Import the packages you need
    from lightkurve.correctors import RegressionCorrector, DesignMatrix

Next, we are going to define a design matrix which will contain all the
systematics detected in the pixels outside of our aperture.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Make a design matrix and pass it to a linear regression corrector
    dm = DesignMatrix(S32.flux[:, ~aper_new], name='regressors')#.pca(5).append_constant()

We only want the most dominant vectors and so specify the number of
principle componant (PCA) as follows,

.. code:: ipython3

    dm = dm.pca(10)
    plt.plot(S32.time.value, dm.values + np.arange(10)*0.2, '.');



.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_35_0.png


From this we can see that 10 is excessive and we should probably use
only 5. Let’s do this and plot it up.

.. code:: ipython3

    dm = DesignMatrix(S32.flux[:, ~aper_new], name='regressors').pca(5)
    dm.plot()




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8db9fa0750>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_37_1.png


*Lightkurve’s RegressionCorrector* uses linear algebra to find the
combination of vectors that makes the input light curve closest to zero.
We therefore needed to add one more component - an “offset” term, to be
able to fit the mean level of the light curve. We can do this as shown
above by appending a“constant” to the design matrix.

.. code:: ipython3

    dm = DesignMatrix(S32.flux[:, ~aper_new], name='regressors').pca(5).append_constant()

Next we pass this design matrix to the *RegressionCorrector* which
de-trends the light curves against the vectors.

.. code:: ipython3

    rc = RegressionCorrector(lc_S32)
    rc.correct(dm)
    pltAxis = rc.diagnose()
    pltAxis[0].set_ylim(300, 500);
    pltAxis[1].set_ylim(300, 500);
    
    corrected_ffi_lc = rc.correct(dm)




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_41_0.png


**HOWEVER!** The *RegressionCorrector* assumes that you want to remove
the trend and set the light curve to the mean level.

This isn’t true for *TESS* scattered light, as the *TESS* FFI light
curves have an additive background. As such, we want to reduce the flux
to the lowest recorded level.

To do this, we can look at the model of the background that
*RegressionCorrector* built and apply that. This model should never go
below zero, to ensure that this is the case we only subtract the model
flux value at the 5th percentile.

We can then apply all these factors to the FFI light curve using the
following code,

.. code:: ipython3

    # Optional: Remove the scattered light, allowing for the large offset from scattered light
    corrected_ffi_lc = lc_S32 - rc.model_lc + np.percentile(rc.model_lc.flux, 5)
    corrected_ffi_lc.plot(label='Corrected light curve');



.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_43_0.png


This has removed all the scattered light and the slope, but again could
be adjusted further. However, we will move onto our final tool.

The PLDCorrector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PLD is built on top of *RegressionCorrector* and again works by
identifying a set of trends in the pixels surrounding the target star,
and performing linear regression to create a combination of these trends
that effectively models the noise. This noise model is then subtracted
from the uncorrected light curve. The difference between *PLDCorrector*
and *RegressionCorrector* is that *RegressionCorrector* asks the user to
define the pixels, where as *PLDCorrector* does not.

We will create a *PLDCorrector* object, and use the default values for
PLDCorrector.correct to remove this scattered light background.

.. code:: ipython3

    from lightkurve.correctors import PLDCorrector
    pld_S32 = PLDCorrector(S32)
    pld_S32.correct(pca_components=5)
    pltAxis = pld_S32.diagnose()
    pltAxis[0].set_ylim(300, 500);
    pltAxis[1].set_ylim(300, 500);
    pltAxis[2].set_ylim(300, 500);
    
    corrected_pldlc = pld_S32.correct(pca_components=5)



.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_45_0.png


We can also examine the apertures used to perform this correction. For
*TESS*, the dominant source of noise is the scattered light background,
so by default only those pixels will be used. In the third panel, we can
see that the background_aperture_mask contains only background pixels,
reducing the risk of contamination by neighboring stars.

.. code:: ipython3

    pld_S32.diagnose_masks();



.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_47_0.png


Now lets specifically look at our corrected light curve.

.. code:: ipython3

    corrected_pldlc.plot()




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f8d9df0c690>




.. image:: images/NoiseRemoval/output_49_1.png


The large spike from the scattered light has sucessfully been identified
and removed, but there is a slope in our data still. We can determine
from the diagnostic plots that this is due to the application of a flat
background, unlike that which was applied in *RegressionCorrection*.

Note that there are various componants that can be altered in *PLD* most
of which can be found
`here <https://docs.lightkurve.org/reference/api/lightkurve.correctors.PLDCorrector.correct.html?highlight=pca_components>`__.

Comparison
----------

Let’s now plot up all of our corrected light curves in addition to the
light curve originally derived from the FFI’s, and compare our results.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Lets plot and compare the different methods 
    ax = lc_S32.normalize().remove_outliers().scatter(color='black', label='Uncorrected Light Curve');
    # Plot the CBV-corrected light curve in green
    cbvcorrector_lc.normalize().remove_outliers().scatter(ax=ax, color='green', label='CBV-corrected Light Curve')
    # Plot the regressor-corrected light curve in blue
    corrected_ffi_lc.normalize().remove_outliers().scatter(ax=ax, color='blue', label='Regressor-corrected Light Curve')
    # Plot the PLD-corrected light curve in red 
    corrected_pldlc.normalize().remove_outliers().scatter(ax=ax, color='red', label='PLD-corrected Light Curve')




.. parsed-literal::

Summary
-------

The plot above indicaates that there is no one solution. The result from
the *RegressionCorrector* seems to have removed the most scattered light
and the slope in the data, whilst retaining the periodicity.

As you may have discovered, removing the noise from the data can be a
complex issue with multiple paths. You should always examine your method
of noise removal and inspect all final products.
