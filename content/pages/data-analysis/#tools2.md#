[TOC]

Several tools exist to help the user obtain and examine TESS data, below we outline these tools.

## [lightkurve](https://docs.lightkurve.org)
Lightkurve is a Python-based package developed by the Kepler/K2 Guest
Observer (GO) Office for use by the community to work with Kepler and K2 data. The TESS GI Office has partnered with the Kepler/K2 GO Office to develop lightkurve for use with TESS data. 

Lighkurve functionality:

* Reading, writing, and interacting with pipeline products (TPFs, LightCurve files, etc) 
* Extracting lightcurves from pixels using custom aperture photometry or custom PSF fitting. 
* Removing trends or correcting systematics using widely-used, non-controversial methods (SavGol, CBVs, SFF, ...)

The lightkurve git repository is [here](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve).

In addition to the tutorials found [here](https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/index.html) you can find TESS specific tutorials listed below.
