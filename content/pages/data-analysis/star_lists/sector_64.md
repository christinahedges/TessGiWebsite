##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
272314138, 342884451, 38877693, 179323446, 30247429, and 314113726.

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
300015238, 261862960, 450568600

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.


#Same pixel stars

Stars which lie within the same pixel of a very bright star. In this case,
no optimal aperture was assigned
