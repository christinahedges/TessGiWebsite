##Targets not processed in 20-sec pipeline:
399646462 and 471011144

#Same pixel stars: 20-sec
402558381

Stars which lie within the same pixel of a very bright star. In this case,
no optimal aperture was assigned

##Blended stars in 20-sec candence observations:
402558381 and 426452678 

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
314113726, 399646462, 238196512, 128116539, 471011144, 262834160, 38877693, 471011145, 255559489

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
125080828, 450568600, 328329822, 402546736, 426452678, 307569010,
300015238, 300015239

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.
