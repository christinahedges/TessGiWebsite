##Blended targets in 20-second cadence observations
441804565, 341873045, and 1551711135

These stars are blended with comparably bright stars. The contaminating flux for these objects is very large, and the resulting photometry is expected to be unreliable.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
229540730

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
441804565, 341873045, and 1551711135

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Stars with a single pixel disjoint from the rest of the optimal aperture, caused by crowding from nearby stars.
