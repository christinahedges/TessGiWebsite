[TOC]

TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 36.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
238196512, 272884654, 31975064, 342884451, 38877693, and 438741592

##Blended stars:
429149602, 429149604, 429149606, 500178562, 303297349, 864636104, 362937274, 846550604, 846550616, 300015238, 300015239, 167602316, and 766018849

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

#Bleed trail not captured
386296645

The pixel stamp did not fully capture the bleed trails.

#Disjointed aperture
309151373


Caused by the pipelineâ€™s attempt to avoid the bleed trails of eps Car. The photometry of this source is likely unreliable because the photometric aperture is disjoint.
