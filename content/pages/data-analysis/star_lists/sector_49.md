TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 49.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
229540730.

##Blended stars:
341873045, 17668162, 159190005

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Crowded stars:
954006097, 903621263, 310362805, 159164209, 1551711135, 1001230963

Objects with a disjoint aperture due to crowding with a bright neighbor and so likely has unreliable photometry.
