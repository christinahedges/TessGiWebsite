TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 58.

##Blended targets in 20-second cadence observations
441804565, 341873045, and 1551711135

These stars are blended with comparably bright stars. The contaminating flux for these objects is very large, and the resulting photometry is expected to be unreliable.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
306349516, 329269366, 186744198, 292057658, and 51962733

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
(441804565, 341873045, 1551711135, 445258198, 620612499, and 621646082

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Stars in same pixel of a very bright star
504952282 and 2022482049

Here no optimal aperture is assigned

##Disjoint apertures
518659900 and 500337861

Disjoint apertures due to crowding with bright neighbors and likely have unreliable photometry.
