[TOC]

TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 35.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
255559489, 342884451, 31975064, 46799297, 38877693, and 134501440

##Blended stars:
766018849, 500178562, 354825493, 300015238, 167602316

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

#Bleed trail not captured
354825513

The pixel stamp did not fully capture the bleed trails.

#Disjointed aperture
309292175

Caused by the pipelineâ€™s attempt to avoid the bleed trails of eps Car. The photometry of this source is likely unreliable because the photometric aperture is disjoint.
