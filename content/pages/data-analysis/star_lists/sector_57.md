##Blended targets in 20-second cadence observations
441804565, 341873045, and 1551711135

These stars are blended with comparably bright stars. The contaminating flux for these objects is very large, and the resulting photometry is expected to be unreliable.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
174500619 and 260614141

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
502687433, 441804565, 341873045, 2022482049, 1551711135

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.
