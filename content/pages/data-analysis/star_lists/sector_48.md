##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
99843265, 229540730, 95431294, and 8172111.

##Blended stars:
801604587, 441804565, 229686919, 141120277, 1551711135, and 341873045

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Crowded stars:
150388950

Object with a  disjoint aperture due to crowding with a bright neighbor and so likely has unreliable photometry.
