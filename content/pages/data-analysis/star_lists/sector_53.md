##Blended targets in 20-second cadence observations
TIC 441804568 and 1551711135

These stars are blended with comparably bright stars. The contaminating flux for these objects is very large, and the resulting photometry is expected to be unreliable.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
164642404, 157587146, 329269366, 303256075, and 229540730

##Blended stars in 2-min cadence observations:
518659900, 460067872, 441804565, 341873045, 172751954, 1551711135,
and 1308480726

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

##Disjointed apertures:
460067872 and 336130128

These targets have disjoint apertures due to crowding with
bright neighbors and likely have unreliable photometry.

##Bleed trails:
141678682
This object has a pixel stamp that does not fully capture the bleed trails
