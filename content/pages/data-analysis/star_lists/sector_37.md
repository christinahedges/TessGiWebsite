TIC ID's that had issues in Sector 37.

##Targets not processed in 2-min pipeline:
272314138, 342884451, 38877693, 272884654, 30247429, 314113726, and 290794924

##Blended stars:
300015238, 261862960, 260370233, 167602316, 303297349, 362937274, 766018849, 846550616, 864636104

A star is considered to be bended when its flux has been significantly contaminated by a nearby bright star(s). Since the contaminating flux is considered very large, the resulting photometry for such targets is expected to be unreliable.

#Bleed trail not captured
272482277 and 846550616

These stars lie very close to the bleed trails of saturated stars. In these cases, no optimal aperture was assigned. Target pixel files with original and calibrated pixel data are provided, but no light curves were produced.

386072621 is close enough to the bleed trail from a brighter star that the photometry is likely unreliable
