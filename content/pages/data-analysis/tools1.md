Title: Observation Tools

[TOC]

Below we outline some tools that help will help you, the user, plan your observations.

## [Web TESS Viewing (WTV) tool](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py)
The WTV tool allows users to check whether a target potentially falls within the
TESS field of view (FOV). In addition, WTV can be used to calculate
the brightness of a target in the TESS bandpass. 

## [TESS-Point](https://github.com/christopherburke/tess-point)
This is a High Precision TESS pointing tool. It will convert target
coordinates given in Right Ascension and Declination to TESS detector
pixel coordinates for the first 13 TESS observing sectors (Year 1)
focused on the southern ecliptic plane. It can also query MAST to
obtain detector pixel coordinates for a star by TIC ID only. It provides the target ecliptic coordinates, sector number, camera number, detector number, and pixel column and row. If there is no output, then the target is not visible to TESS.

See our [proposal tools page](proposal-tools.html) for additional resources that aid in the preparation of GI proposals.
