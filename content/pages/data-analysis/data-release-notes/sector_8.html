       <td colspan="5" >At TJD 1531.74, an interruption in communications between the instrument and spacecraft occurred, resulting in an instrument turn-off until TJD 1535.00. No data or telemetry were collected during this period. After the instrument anomaly the heaters were turned on, increasing the camera temperature by ∼ 20◦ to approximately −67◦ C. Once the camera power was restored, the heaters were turned off and the camera temperatures returned to nominal within three days. The temperature increase caused changes in the camera focal plane scale and mean black levels of individual CCD channels. The mean black levels are calibrated out in the SPOC pipeline. Changes in focal plane temperature cause changes in the raw photometry, but the PDC systematic error-correction algorithm removes this effect for most targets</td>

       <td colspan="5" >At the start of each orbit, the Earth was close to the boresight of Camera 1, and the level of scattered light was too high for meaningful guide star centroids to be measured. Guiding with Camera 1 was therefore disabled at these times. When Camera 1 guiding was re-enabled, the spacecraft attitude shifted by a small amount, about 1 arc-second (0.05 pixels). These times are marked with Attitude Tweak flags in the data products.</td>
