       <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Spacecraft pointing:</td>
       <td colspan="5">During sector 3 there were several experiments conducted on the attitude control system (ACS) to improve pointing stability. Tests were conducted during the perigee passages after orbits 12, 13 and 14, as well as the first 3 days of orbit 13 and the last 3 days of orbit 14. During these times, the ACS feedback loop was altered and the calibration parameters tuned.  The jitter profile during these times differs substantially from the normal data collection mode, which used the same ACS configuration as in Sectors 1 and 2. Imaging and light curve data during these tests is provided for completeness, but has limited use for scientific applications. Valid data in the standard ACS configuration were collected between TJD 1385.8966 and 1395.4800 in orbit 13 and between TJD 1396.6050 and 1406.2925 in orbit 14, spanning ∼20.4 days of useful observations.</td>

       <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Scattered light:</td>
       <td colspan="5">In Sector 3, the main stray light feature is caused by the Earth rising above the sunshade near the end of each orbit, resulting in an enhancement of the stray light over parts of each camera’s FOV.</td>
       </tr>


              <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Timing precision and accuracy:</td>
       <td colspan="5">The clock kernel used to process Sector 3 data has a slight error, resulting from extrapolation of timing measurements made during Sector 1. The reported TJD values in all data products are therefore offset by ∼1.2 seconds  at the end of orbit 14 (2018-10-17 UTC).</td>
