At these low angles, the level of scattered light is too high for meaningful guide star centroids to be measured - see Guiding issue above. Disabling Camera 1 guiding near the end of the Sector caused a brief impulse in pointing, which settled out within minutes. </td>

The error between true and calculated times grew linearly with time since August 2018, so that the calculated TJD values in all data products are offset from the correct values by ∼1.7 seconds at the end of orbit 18 (2018-12-11 UTC). See pg. 7 of the DRN for more information.</td>
