This configuration causes the apparent pointing of Cameras 1, 2 and 3 to drift by larger amounts than in other sectors due to differential velocity aberration. The amplitude of the drift depends on each camera, and has a maximum value of 3 arc-seconds (0.14 pixels) in Camera 1 from the beginning to end of orbit 31. In orbit 32, both Camera 1 and Camera 4 were used for guiding for the entire duration of the orbit.</p></td>
