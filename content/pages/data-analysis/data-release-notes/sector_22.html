  Warning for Sector 22: Four FFI cadences and two 2-minute cadences were lost due to computer issues.
A ~2 second error in data product timestamps has been corrected for starting with Sector 22. Previous data products will be corrected as they are reprocessed.

       <p>Timestamps from previous sectors can be corrected by subtracting 2 seconds. Future data releases will include reprocessed data with corrected timestamps.</p>
       <p>The start times of integrations for every 2 minute and 30 minute cadence have been shifted forward by 31 milliseconds, and the end times have been shifted forward by 11 milliseconds.</p>
       <p>These offsets correct for effects in the focal plane electronics that were not accounted for in previous data releases. Until data is re-processed the times must be adjusted by adding correct values to headers.</p>
       <p>Two-minute data products report the TJD at mid-exposure, and so should be corrected by adding 21 milliseconds to the timestamps.</p>
       <p>Note that the correction only applies to the timestamps themselves; the reported exposure times in data product headers and flux values (electrons per second) are correct.</p></td>
