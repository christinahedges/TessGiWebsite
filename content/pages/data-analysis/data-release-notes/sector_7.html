       <td colspan="5">Some channels show a small non-zero residual in the mean black level after calibration that is either static (e.g., camera 3, CCD 2, output D) or slowly time varying (e.g., camera 4, CCD 1, all outputs and camera 4, CCD 3, all outputs). The level of these residuals is minor i.e., ∼ 1e<sup>-3</sup> ADU/read and the timescale of variation is of order 5–10 days. These residuals are thought to be caused by the jitter of bright stars on the specific CCD slices, and therefore it is a persistent effect in the rest of the sectors. The impact of these residuals on scientific output is likely negligible. However, the Sector 7 data were calibrated using the updated 1-D black method, from which we do not expect such time-varying residuals.</td>
