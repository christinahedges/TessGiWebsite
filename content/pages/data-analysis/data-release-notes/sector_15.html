  Warning for Sector 15: A single upset event in the star trackers caused the spacecraft to fall out of fine pointing in orbit 38. The issue lasts for 5 minutes at TJD 1725.93651 (cadences 358907, 358908, and 358909).

Camera 1 still suffers from strong scattered light signals, and so guiding was disabled in Camera 1 for both orbits 37 and 38. Camera 4 alone was used for guiding during this sector.</td>

The 24 hour rotation period of the Earth and several harmonics thereof are visible as oscillations in the background for most of both orbits. Finally, the Earth passes close to Camera 1 towards the last quarter of each orbit and saturates the detectors—these times were excluded with CCD-specific “Scattered Light” flags.</td>

	   - Cadences with insufficient targets to derive cotrending basis vectors are flagged and the PDCSAP FLUX light curves are set to NULL at these times<p></p>
	   The modifications to the data anomaly flags also changed the cotrended light curves produced by PDC. The changes also result in new cotrending basis vectors for each CCD in each sector. The scattered light flags are now only applied to the PDCSAP FLUX light curves.</td>
