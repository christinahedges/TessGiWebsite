   Sector 19 was reprocessed in September 2020, updating timestamps, photometric apertures, data anomaly flags, and threshold crossing events. For more deatil please see the Reprocessing Information table below.

  Warning for Sector 19: In orbit 46—no data were collected for four minutes due to an instrument reset.
The FFI timestamps for Sector 19 do not account for the 0.5 second staggered readouts of the four cameras. The offsets for each camera can be added to the TSTART and TSTOP header values in the FFIs to correct the issue.
