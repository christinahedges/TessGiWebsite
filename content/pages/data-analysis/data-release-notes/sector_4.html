 <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Incorrect guide star table</td>
       <td colspan="5">An incorrect table was  into the DHU at the beginning of Sector 4. The spacecraft pointing was offset by ∼4 arc-seconds from where it would have pointed had the correct guide star table been loaded. Thus, once the correct guide star table was loaded (TJD 1413.26), the spacecraft pointing shifted by ∼4 arc-seconds.<td>

 <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Instrument reset:</td>
       <td colspan="5">At TJD 1418.54, an interruption in communications between the instrument and space- craft occurred, resulting in an instrument turn-off until TJD 1421.21. No data or telemetry were collected during this period. After the instrument anomaly the heaters were turned on , increasing the camera temperature by ∼ 20◦ to approximately −67◦ C. Once the camera power was restored, the heaters were turned off and the camera temperatures returned to nominal within three days. The temperature increase caused changes in the camera focal plane scale and mean black levels of individual CCD channels.  The mean black levels are calibrated out in the SPOC pipeline.</td>

       <td colspan="3">Spacecraft pointing:</td>
       <td colspan="5">Sector 4 was the first set of science observations with an improved Attitude Control System (ACS) algorithm. The new ACS mode displays significantly lower pointing jitter than the previous configuration.</td>

       <td colspan="3">Scattered light:</td>
       <td colspan="5">In Sector 4, the main stray light feature are caused by the Earth rising above the sunshade at the end of each orbit. The Earth reaches a minimum of 35 degrees from the center of Camera 1, and strong glints appear between TJD 1422.2297 and 1423.5020 (orbit 15) and between TJD 1436.1047 and 1436.8353 (orbit 16).</td>

       <tr>
       <td colspan="3">Timing precision and accuracy:</td>
       <td colspan="5">The clock kernel used to process Sector 4 data has a slight error, resulting from extrapolation of timing measurements made during Sector 1. The reported TJD values in all data products are therefore offset by ∼1.6 seconds at the end of orbit 16 (2018-11-14 UTC).</td>
