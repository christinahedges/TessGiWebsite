Title: The primary mission

[TOC]

The TESS primary mission ran from July 25th 2018 until July 4th 2020 (note that ground-based follow up for the primary mission continued until 2021) . Within this two year mission TESS searched for planets outside of our solar system with a primary goal of finding nearby planets that are amenable to characterization with ground-based follow-up surveys. Specifically, the primary science requirements of the TESS mission were as follows:

1. Search over 200,000 stars to discover planets with periods <10 days and radii <2.5 Earth radii orbiting the brightest stars in the solar neighborhood and discover planets with radii at least 2.5 Earth radii distributed across the celestial sphere.

2. Search for transiting planets with periods up to 120 days among the ~10,000 stars in regions surrounding the ecliptic poles.

3. Determine the masses for at least 50 planets with radii <4 Earth radii. 

The TESS primary mission surveyed stars with spectral types ranging from F5 to M5 to searching for transiting exoplanets. Additional follow-up with ground- and space-based missions, including NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, have and will allow astronomers to study the atmospheres of many of these planets. The TESS legacy is catalog of the nearest and brightest main-sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets, see our [data access page](data-access.html) for a list of TESS data catalogs.

In addition to its search for exoplanets, the TESS primary mission allowed scientists from the wider community to request targets for astrophysics research on approximately 10,000 additional objects through each cycle of its [Guest Investigator program](proposing-investigations.html).

## How TESS searches for planets

The TESS mission searches for planets via the transit method, the same method used by the Kepler Mission. The transit method of detecting exoplanets involves monitoring the brightness of many stars to look for periodic dips that could reveal planets crossing in front of the stars, blocking a fraction of their light, as viewed from the spacecraft. Transit photometry allows a very precise measure of a planet's orbital period. The depth of the folded transit light curve can reveal the planet's size compared to the star's size, and the width can reveal the duration of the transit.

## Sky coverage

TESS is equipped with four CCD cameras that have adjacent field-of-views to produce a 4 x 1 array, or 'observing sector', yielding a combined field-of-view of 96x 24 degrees, as illustrated below.

Since 2018 TESS has observed approximately 85% of the sky (an area 400 times larger than that monitored by Kepler), and as such has observe many more nearby, bright stars compared to the Kepler Mission.

### Observing strategy

Within the primary mission TESS imaged [26 individual sectors](sector.html), 13 in the southern hemisphere and 13 in the northern hemisphere. Each hemisphere was observed for 1 year each, beginning in the south in July 2018. Each sector was observed for two orbits (27.4 days total), and once complete, TESS re-orientated to the next sector moving eastward until the hemisphere was tiled by 13 sectors.

Within each 96 x 24 degree sector TESS observed 15,000 target stars on a 2 minute cadence and collected full frame images at 30 minute cadence. The sectors have ecliptic latitudes from 6 degrees to the ecliptic pole with increasing overlap at higher latitudes. There was  350 days of continuous coverage in the Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ) at the ecliptic poles, which corresponds to the region accessible to NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

A video illustrating the TESS survey strategy, along with the pathway to the spacecraft orbit, can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpViVEO-ymc).

## Types of stars monitored

The stars TESS has studies are typically 30 to 100 times brighter than those that the Kepler mission surveyed, this enabled far easier follow-up observations with both ground-based and space-based telescopes.

## Period sensitivity

The orbital periods that TESS is sensitive to depends on the fraction of overlap among the sectors, which depends on the ecliptic latitude. Closer to the ecliptic, a field will have at most 27 days of coverage, meaning planet orbital periods will need to be shorter than this duration. Detecting 3 transits is ideal to constrain the orbit, but many 2-transit planet candidates will be found, necessitating additional follow-up to measure additional transits. At higher latitudes, the overlap of sectors will enable 351 days of coverage per year.
