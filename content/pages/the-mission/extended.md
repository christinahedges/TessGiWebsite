Title: The Extended mission
Save_as: extended.html

[TOC]

TESS completed its [prime mission](primary.html) on July of 2020 and has now entered into its extended mission.
The extended mission will last approximately two years and will continue to scan the sky for exoplanets and transient events.
The TESS mission will be more community focused with its next two years of operation.

As with previous Cycles, Cycles 3 and 4 of extended mission will solicit [Guest Investigator proposals](proposing-investigations.html). 
A Cycle 3 call for proposals occurred on March 14th 2019, with Cycle 4 occurring on February 14th 2020.

## Observing Strategy

TESS Cycle 3 will observe fields in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere and be collected during the first year of the extended mission, from July 2020 until June 2021. It will cover sectors 27-39 as shown below.

## Data Products

The following data products will  be obtainable within Cycles 3 and 4.

* 2-minute cadence data for a select number of targets
* 20-second cadence data for observations.
* 10-minute full frame images instead of 30-minute.

The 20-second cadence mode will be allotted to ~1000 targets per sector.
There will be a ten times  increase in the  number  of 2-minute cadenced targets in the GI program, ~15,000 target slots in each sector.

Key-Project proposal categories are now available. These are programs that will have a maximum duration of  27 months and as such cover Cycle 3 and 4.

Ground-based observing focused programs are also solicited provided that they support the analysis and/or interpretation of TESS data. Up to $500K will be used to support ground-based programs.

Within Cycle 3 TESS will observe each sector continuously for two spacecraft orbits, ~28 days. The 10-minute and 20-second sub images taken during Cycle 3 will be considered 'shared  risk', as possible modifications to the observing plan may occur following testing and evaluation.

## Information on the call for GI proposals

* Large programs and Key Projects will be allowed a 5-page limit for the scientific/technical/management section.
* References are not included in the page limit for proposals.
* Joint TESS-Swift proposals are called for. There will be 100 ks of Swift time available for TESS-focused projects. 
* Proposals aimed at detecting small planets in 2-minute cadenced data solicited.

As with data collected during the primary mission there is no proprietary period for data obtained through TESS observations. 
Data is made available through [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite-tess).

GI proposals may include theoretical components, software development, and/or data simulation that strengthens the proposal, 
but at least 70% of the work effort should be focused on exploiting TESS data products. This rule however does not apply to ground-based
observing proposals. Proposed investigations must also focus on using the relevant Cycles data, i.e., not Cycles 1 or 2.

Funding is only available to scientists at US based institutes whom are identified as the Principal Investigator (PI). Sub-awards are made available only to Civil Servant Co-Is that are eligible for direct sub-awards. Funding will be initiated only after the first data for targets have been uploaded to MAST.

The Cycle 3 review process has already taken place with targets selected, for additional information on how to apply for TESS Cycle 4 please see the [TESS Cycle 4 NRA](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7}&path=open)
